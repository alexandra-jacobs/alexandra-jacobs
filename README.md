# About Me
Hi! You can call me Alex or Alexandra whichever you prefer. Here is some non GIS-related information about me: I grew up in Indiana about 45 minutes south of Chicago and moved out to Denver, CO in July 2021. I love snowboarding, hiking, bouldering, climbing, volleyball... pretty much any outdoor activity so Colorado has been a perfect fit for me! I am also an avid oil painter.
